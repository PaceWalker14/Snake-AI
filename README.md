#Snake-AI
Snake AI is a Java-based project where an autonomous agent (MyAgent.java) plays the classic Snake game intelligently. The game runs through a provided SnakeRunner.jar file that launches the simulation.

How it works:

Game state handling: The agent receives the current position of the snake, the food, and obstacles on the board each turn.
Direction control: The AI calculates which move (up, down, left, right) to take based on its analysis of the board.
Collision avoidance: Before moving, it checks for potential collisions with walls or its own body.
Food targeting: It identifies the nearest food and attempts to navigate toward it efficiently.
Fallback logic: If the direct path to food is blocked, the agent safely reroutes to prevent getting trapped.
